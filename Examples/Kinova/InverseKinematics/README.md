# Kinova Inverse Kinematics Example

`KinovaIKExample.cpp` provides the simplest example of solving an inverse kinematics problem on Kinova.
Both analytical gradient and hessian are provided to Ipopt.

`KinovaIKMotionExample.cpp` provides an example of solving a series of inverse kinematics problems,
so that the end effector goes forward for 10 cm along its z axis.
