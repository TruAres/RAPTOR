This folder contains an implementation of an discrete version of [WAITR](https://roahmlab.github.io/waitr-dev/).
Instead of guaranteeing safety on continuous time intervals, we only validate constraints on discrete time nodes.
This could be used to provide good initial guesses for [WAITR](https://roahmlab.github.io/waitr-dev/) because this runs much faster than [WAITR](https://roahmlab.github.io/waitr-dev/).
