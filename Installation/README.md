# Installation of required packages

First clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/roahmlab/RAPTOR.git
```

## Install Through Docker (Recommended)

We strongly recommend using Docker. We have provided a Dockerfile that will automatically install all the required packages. If you don't have Docker installed, you can find the installation instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository).

### HSL
You should complete HSL steps BEFORE you build the docker image otherwise you will have error.

We have selected [HSL](https://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/) to solve large linear systems in the nonlinear optimization problem. 
Please follow the instructions below to complete the installation.
Note that this is ONLY for SINGLE PRECISION version!!!
<!-- Besides official HSL code, we used [ThirdParty-HSL](https://github.com/coin-or-tools/ThirdParty-HSL), which is specifically tailored for COIN-OR projects, particularly Ipopt, offering easier integration and installation.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/coin-or-tools/ThirdParty-HSL.git. 
    ```
1. Download the tarball containing the Coin-HSL source code from its official [website](https://licences.stfc.ac.uk/product/coin-hsl). You will need to apply a license for it. The academic license is free but it could take 1 or 2 days to process the order.
2. Download code from [ThirdParty-HSL](https://github.com/coin-or-tools/ThirdParty-HSL).
3. Unpack the Coin-HSL source code and rename the folder as `coinhsl`.
4. Place the `coinhsl` folder inside [ThirdParty-HSL](https://github.com/coin-or-tools/ThirdParty-HSL) folder, which serves as a wrapper to simplify the compilation and integration of HSL.
5. Rename the [ThirdParty-HSL](https://github.com/coin-or-tools/ThirdParty-HSL) folder as `HSL`,then compress it into a `HSL.zip` file. Note: This zip file will later be 'unziped' and built inside the docker container. -->

1. Go to [HSL MA57](https://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/catalogue/hsl_ma57.html) official website. Click `Code Download` and follow its instructions. After submitting the request, wait a few minute for email reply.
2. Download the code in the link that HSL provides you. The name of the zip file and the folder inside it is going to be `hsl_ma57` + its version number. 
3. Extract the code and rename the folder as `hsl_ma57`. Compress the folder again and rename the zip file as `hsl_ma57.zip` (just make sure both of them are named as `hsl_ma57` by removing the version number).
4. Note: This zip file will later be 'unziped' and built inside the docker container.

### Docker
The provided Dockerfile is at [docker/Dockerfile](../docker/Dockerfile). 
Follow the following intructions to build and enter the docker image.

1. Move the `hsl_ma57.zip` file in `docker/` so that dockerfile can find it.
2. In Visual Studio Code, simply click `ctrl+shift+P` and search "Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen Container", it will build the environment automatically for you from [docker/Dockerfile](../docker/Dockerfile) so that you don't need to follow the steps below.

## Install Required Packages Independently
All of the following instructions are assuming that the packages are installed to root directories,
like /usr/local or /usr.
You might need to edit your ~/.basrc so that the environment variable PATH includes /usr/local/bin and
LD_LIBRARY_PATH includes /usr/local/lib.
Be careful if you are using a shared server.

### GSL
```shell
sudo apt-get install libgsl-dev
```

### Boost
```shell
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
```

### yaml-cpp
```shell
sudo apt-get install libyaml-cpp-dev
```

<!-- ### urdfdom
```shell
sudo apt-get install liburdfdom-dev
``` -->

### Eigen 3.4
In Ubuntu 22.04, the Eigen library version is 3.4.0 by default. Simply do
```shell
sudo apt install libeigen3-dev
```
In Ubuntu 20.04, the Eigen library version is 3.3.7 by default.
You will have to go to the official [website](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=3.4) and manually install it.

### pinocchio
Please refer to the offical website [link](https://stack-of-tasks.github.io/pinocchio/download.html).

One small issue could be: `pinocchio` would recommend you install through `robotpkg` on Linux systems, while some people mainly works with `pinocchio` in Python so they install `pinocchio` through `conda`.
`robotpkg` installs `pinocchio` in `/opt/openrobots/` while `conda` installs `pinocchio` in `~/miniconda3/`.
Try to avoid installing two `pinocchio` on your computer.
If you have to, be sure to specify the paths carefully when you try to link your program to `pinocchio`.

### Ipopt
Please refer to this [link](https://coin-or.github.io/Ipopt/INSTALL.html).

Note that in section "Download, build, and install dependencies", you actually only to install one of the external libraries.
We choose [HSL](https://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/) to solve large linear systems in a nonlinear optimization problem.

Check this [github repository](https://github.com/coin-or-tools/ThirdParty-HSL) out and follow the instructions there.
To be more specific, you need to get HSL library from its official [website](https://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/), 
and then put the folder inside [ThirdParty-HSL](https://github.com/coin-or-tools/ThirdParty-HSL).
After compilation, you should be able to find the library `libcoinhsl.so` installed in /usr/local/lib.
If not, please manually move them to `/usr/local/lib` so that it is easier for cmake to find them automatically.

I have had one issue before where ipopt tries to find `libhsl.so` instead of `libcoinhsl.so`. 
So `libhsl.so` is the actual name of this library while `libcoinhsl.so` is the name when compiled in the [ThirdParty-HSL](https://github.com/coin-or-tools/ThirdParty-HSL) wrapper.
You might need to create a symbolic link manually 
```shell
sudo ln -s libcoinhsl.so libhsl.so
```
There are a lot of moving pieces here so something might not work or my README is still not enough.
Please contact me (jimzhang@umich.edu) if you encounter any problems installing ipopt.
